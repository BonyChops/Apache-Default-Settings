# Apache-Default-Settings
This script is made for me so I won't take any responsibility if you run this script and have some trouble.
## What this will do
- Install apache2 and latest php
- Change document root from /var/www to ~/html
## Support
- Ubuntu 18.04+
## Run this script
Just run:
```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BonyChops/Apache-Default-Settings/master/run.sh)

This script will require root permission (to install apache2 and php).
